Nova Plasma Ltd. was formed by Chen Porat, Amnon Lam and Ronen Lam. Nova's goal is to develop and commercialize a platform technology that enables the surface modification of implantable devices, via cold plasma, on-site, just prior to implantation or use. The technology is relevant to a broad range of applications including dental implants, orthopedics, spine, bone grafts, and silicone implant.

During its first two years of operation, the company focused on the development of a proprietary technology for on-site surface modification of dental implants, making them highly hydrophilic just prior to implantation. Studies have shown that highly hydrophilic implants improve osseo-integration, secondary fixation, and early loading. The dental implant product has completed all safety testing and Nova is currently in commercial discussions.

In addition, the company's current is developing a proprietary and innovative product that mitigates the Capsular Contracture of breast implants, a significant post-surgery issue for many patients. Nova is planning to apply its proprietary surface modification technology, referred to as the Active Siâ„¢ Plasma System, to silicone breast implants, making them immediately super hydrophilic just prior to being dipped in antibiotic solution, a usual and customary step preceding implantation.
